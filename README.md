# DesignPatternLab
## SSW345 Christian Kubelle

### Purpose of this Lab: 
This manual is intended for enhancing understanding of the subject of Design Patterns. 
The design process is typically split into distinct phases: Object Oriented Design (OOD) and Design Patterns. Typically, the time spent on getting the design right before you start programming will almost always save you time in the end. It's much, much easier to make major changes on a design, which is after all just squiggly lines on paper, and then it is to make changes in hundreds or thousands of lines of code.

### Patterns Learned:
- Singleton Pattern
- Visitor Pattern


### Languages Used:
- Java
- JavaScript
